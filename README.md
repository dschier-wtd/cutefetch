# Cutefetch

A super minimal screen fetch for bash. Written in Go and more or less for my own
demand and exercises.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about Go and have a nice screen fetch alternative,
matching my cute'ish desktop theme. Therefore, I started to work on this piece
of code.`

## Description

It's just a small screen fetch.

## Contribute

The screen fetch is intended to be used by myself. Therefore, I don't consider
that there will be a lot of contribution. In case you like it, want to modify it
and enhance the code, please feel free to open a Pull Request or suggest a
feature.
