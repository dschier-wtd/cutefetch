# Cutefetch

A super minimal prompt for bash. Written in Go and more or less for my own
demand and exercises.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about Go and have a nice prompt, matching my cute'ish
desktop theme. Therefore, I started to work on this piece of code.`

## Description

It's just a small prompt.

## Contribute

The prompt is intended to be used by myself. Therefore, I don't consider that
there will be a lot of contribution. In case you like the prompt, want to
modify it and enhance the code, please feel free to open a Pull Request.
